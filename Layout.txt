The layout consists of four major parts:

Wrapper .wrapper. A div that wraps the whole site.
Main Header .main-header. Contains the logo and navbar.
Sidebar .sidebar-wrapper. Contains the user panel and sidebar menu.
Content .content-wrapper. Contains the page header and content.

Important: You cannot use both layout-boxed and fixed at the same time

AdminLTE 2.0 provides a set of options to apply to your main layout. Each one of these classes can be added to the body tag to get the desired goal.

Fixed: use the class .fixed to get a fixed header and sidebar.
Collapsed Sidebar: use the class .sidebar-collapse to have a collapsed sidebar upon loading.
Boxed Layout: use the class .layout-boxed to get a boxed layout that stretches only to 1250px.
Top Navigation use the class .layout-top-nav to remove the sidebar and have your links at the top navbar.

Important: To use this main header instead of the regular one, you must add the layout-top-nav class to the body tag.
